# Store Route Optimization & Mapping Tool
This Python-based project optimizes delivery/store visitation routes using geospatial data and visualizes them on an interactive map. It leverages Folium for mapping, OSMnx for distance calculations, and OR-Tools (Googleâ€™s optimization library) to solve the routing problem efficiently.

Features
Geospatial Visualization: Plot store locations on an interactive map using Folium.

Route Optimization: Compute the shortest path between stores using OR-Tools.

Distance Calculation: Fetch real-world road network distances with OSMnx.

Customizable Data: Works with CSV input files containing store addresses and coordinates.

Scalable: Designed to handle multiple locations for logistics planning.

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Folium (Interactive map visualization)

OSMnx (Street network analysis)

OR-Tools (Route optimization)

OpenStreetMap (Geospatial data)
